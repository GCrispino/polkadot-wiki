The Web3 Foundation offers a distinguished [Grant Program](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program#web3-foundation-grants-program) to fund software development and research efforts 
that promote the Web3 ecosystem. 
- For first-time applications, funding up to $30,000 is available. 
- Subsequent grants can receive up tp $100,000 in funding. 

All grants are processed transparently on GitHub and paid out in crypto (BTC, DAI or USDT). Grant
applications that are above these limits, private applications, or requests for fiat payments need to go through KYC and sign a contract.

Accepted applications for both programs can be found
[here](https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/blob/master/grants/accepted_grant_applications.md).

## Alternative Funding Sources

The Polkadot Treasury is a pot of on-chain funds collected through transaction fees, slashing,
staking inefficiencies, etc. The funds held in the treasury can be spent on spending proposals. Both
Polkadot and Kusama offer everyone the opportunity to apply for funding via the treasury. See:
